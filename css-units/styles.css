/*
only absolute unit - pixel (that makes sense to use)

relative units - em, rem, vh, vw, dvh, dvw, ch

percentages - belong to neither

*/


/*

the issue with the pixel unit - is that it does NOT scale (it is an absolute unit after all)

a good use case for pixels however - borders

relative units - can scale up and down
example: rem 


em units

whenever used on a property other than font-size, the em is relative to the font-size of the element in which it is used.

so if say font-size: 1em (16px) and if one sets the padding to 1em, that means the padding is now 1rem = 16px

    padding: 0;

    font-size: 1rem;
